# Shared Game Mixins and Helpers

This document is the operational reference for reusable game infrastructure in `server/game_utils/`.

It is intended to be the first document a human or AI contributor reads before:
- building a new game
- refactoring common game infrastructure
- deciding whether logic belongs in a game file or a shared helper

This doc is deliberately broader than individual docstrings. It explains:
- what shared mixins and helpers exist
- what `Game` already includes by default
- what must be opted into explicitly
- what each shared piece expects from a game
- representative examples in the codebase
- when not to use a shared abstraction

Code docstrings remain the detailed source of truth for exact method signatures and behavior.

## Core Rule

Extract infrastructure, not rules.

Shared modules are a good fit for:
- menu plumbing
- turn order
- action wiring
- common timers
- options systems
- card/dice primitives
- team management
- poker-family mechanics that are actually shared

Shared modules are usually a bad fit for:
- scoring rules unique to one game
- win conditions unique to one game
- special card/piece powers unique to one game
- heavily branching phase logic that only one game uses

If two games only “sound similar” but their rules diverge quickly, keep the rule engine local.

## Big Picture

There are three broad layers in `server/game_utils/`:

1. Core mixins used by `Game`
   - broad infrastructure most games already get automatically
2. Optional mixins
   - specialized behavior a game opts into explicitly
3. Helper modules
   - reusable dataclasses/functions for actions, options, cards, dice, teams, poker, and so on

## What `Game` Already Includes

The base [Game](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/base.py#L86) class already inherits these mixins:
- `GameSoundMixin`
- `GameCommunicationMixin`
- `GameResultMixin`
- `DurationEstimateMixin`
- `GameScoresMixin`
- `GamePredictionMixin`
- `TurnManagementMixin`
- `MenuManagementMixin`
- `ActionVisibilityMixin`
- `LobbyActionsMixin`
- `EventHandlingMixin`
- `ActionSetCreationMixin`
- `ActionExecutionMixin`
- `OptionsHandlerMixin`
- `ActionSetSystemMixin`

That means most games already have this infrastructure without needing extra inheritance.

Representative standard games that rely mostly on `Game` plus local logic:
- [PigGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/pig/game.py)
- [ScopaGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/scopa/game.py)
- [HoldemGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/holdem/game.py)
- [BlackjackGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/blackjack/game.py)

## Optional Mixins a Game Adds Explicitly

Some mixins are not built into `Game` and are added only by games that need them.

Current examples:
- `ActionGuardMixin`
  - used by [MonopolyGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/monopoly/game.py#L595), [RollingBallsGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/rollingballs/game.py#L131), [LeftRightCenterGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/leftrightcenter/game.py#L53)
- `RoundBasedGameMixin`
  - used by [PigGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/pig/game.py#L87), [TossUpGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/tossup/game.py#L81), [MidnightGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/midnight/game.py#L55)
- `PushYourLuckBotMixin`
  - used by [PigGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/pig/game.py#L87), [TossUpGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/tossup/game.py#L81)
- `DiceGameMixin`
  - used by [YahtzeeGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/yahtzee/game.py#L202), [MidnightGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/midnight/game.py#L55), [ThreesGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/threes/game.py#L55)

Use these only when the game structure genuinely matches the existing abstraction.

## Core Mixins Included by `Game`

### `GameSoundMixin`
File: [server/game_utils/game_sound_mixin.py](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/game_utils/game_sound_mixin.py)

Purpose:
- Centralized sound scheduling and playback for games.

What it gives you:
- delayed sound scheduling
- queued sound processing on tick
- broadcast sound/music/ambience helpers
- `play_sound()` convenience use throughout game code

Typical expectations on `Game`:
- `players`

  - [CrazyEightsGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/crazyeights/game.py)

When not to use extra abstraction:
- if a game just needs to call `play_sound`, use the mixin as-is
- do not create a second per-game sound framework unless the existing scheduler is insufficient

Typical expectations on `Game`:

- [ScopaOptions and ScopaGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/scopa/game.py)
- [HoldemOptions and HoldemGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/holdem/game.py)

- if a game needs an unusual setup flow that does not map to standard options menus

## Optional Mixins

These are added directly by games that fit their pattern.

### `ActionGuardMixin`
File: [server/game_utils/action_guard_mixin.py](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/game_utils/action_guard_mixin.py)

Purpose:
- Lightweight organization around guard-style action checks.

Use when:
- the game has many `_is_*_enabled` / `_is_*_hidden` style helpers

- [FarkleGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/farkle/game.py#L288)

When not to use:
- if the game has only a handful of straightforward guards, local methods are usually enough

### Hand Evaluation and Showdown
Files:

- [server/game_utils/poker_showdown.py](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/game_utils/poker_showdown.py)

Purpose:
- shared poker hand scoring
- best-hand selection
- human-readable hand descriptions
- showdown ordering/formatting

Representative consumers:
- [HoldemGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/holdem/game.py)

- split payouts in winner order
- handle odd chips correctly
- resolve multiple pots and optionally apply awards

What is shared now:
- contribution-to-pot conversion
- winner ordering
- odd-chip distribution
- multi-pot payout resolution

What still stays local to each game:
- sound effects
- localized winner announcements
- phase transitions after showdown
- game-specific winner tracking fields

Representative consumers:
- [HoldemGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/holdem/game.py#L891)
- [FiveCardDrawGame](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/games/fivecarddraw/game.py#L770)

## Exported Surface Versus Internal Modules

The exported surface in [server/game_utils/__init__.py](/home/jjm/code/PlayPalace11/server/game_utils/__init__.py) is the broad, intended reusable API for many games.

Not every file in `game_utils/` is exported there.

Specialized modules such as poker helpers are often imported directly from their file because they are family-specific rather than globally shared.

## How to Decide Where New Logic Should Go

### Put logic in a shared mixin or helper when:
- at least two games already need the same infrastructure
- the abstraction boundary is stable
- the behavior is mostly rule-agnostic
- future games are likely to reuse it

### Keep logic in a game file when:
- it is a rule engine
- it is mostly unique to one game
- extracting it would require many game-specific conditionals
- the only commonality is superficial

### Prefer helper modules over new mixins when:
- the logic is mostly pure functions or small data helpers
- the game does not need stateful multiple inheritance

### Prefer mixins over helper modules when:
- the logic expects a `Game` instance shape
- it naturally extends game behavior through methods/hooks
- many methods operate on shared `Game` state
