Leveling System for Pirates of the Lost Seas.

Handles XP gain, level-ups, and skill unlock detection.
Skill unlock levels are defined on each skill class - this system reads from them.

This class inherits from DataClassJSONMixin to ensure serializability.
The game object is NEVER stored - it is only passed as a parameter to methods.
